# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the AI Recipe Wizard repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.

## Project Overview
The AI Recipe Wizard is an application that uses Generative AI to create recipes based on user-provided ingredients. The project will leverage pre-trained language models to generate recipes and an image generation model to visualize the final dish. The app will be deployed using Streamlit as a user facing application.

## Project Objectives
1. Recipe Generation: Use a pre-trained Generative AI model to create unique recipes (including titles, ingredients, and steps).
2. Image Generation: Use an AI model like DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion to create a representative image of the recipe.
3. User Interaction: Build a Streamlit app where users can input ingredients and view generated recipes and images.
4. Scalability (Optional): Ensure the app is modular, allowing for future enhancements (e.g., dietary preferences, additional APIs).

## Project Deliverables:
1. Functional Streamlit Application:
    - A working web-based app deployed locally or on a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud).
2. Recipe Generation Backend:
    - Integration with a pre-trained model like Falcon-7B or GPT-4 for recipe generation.
3. Image Generation Backend:
    - Integration with DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion for image creation.
4. Documentation:
    - Code documentation for easy understanding and maintenance.
    - User guide detailing how to use the application.
5. Deployment Setup:
    - Deployment instructions for running the app on local systems or cloud platforms.
