      "Certainly! Here's a recipe for a delicious Chicken Biryani using the ingredients you've listed:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chicken Biryani\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups basmati rice\n",
      "- 500g chicken, cut into pieces\n",
      "- 2 large onions, thinly sliced\n",
      "- 2 tomatoes, chopped\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons oil or ghee\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds\n",
      "- 2-3 cloves\n",
      "- 2-3 green cardamom pods\n",
      "- 1 bay leaf\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of cinnamon stick\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1/2 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Fresh mint leaves, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Salt to taste\n",
      "- Water\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Rice**\n",
      "   - Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Cook the Chicken**\n",
      "   - Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.\n",
      "   - Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.\n",
      "   - Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute.\n",
      "   - Stir in the tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and some salt. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.\n",
      "   - Add the chicken pieces, mix well, and cook until the chicken is no longer pink.\n",
      "   - Add the yogurt and garam masala. Stir well to coat the chicken. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on medium heat until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cook the Rice**\n",
      "   - In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt to taste.\n",
      "   - Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is 70% cooked (the rice should be firm and slightly undercooked).\n",
      "   - Drain the rice and set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Layering and Cooking**\n",
      "   - In a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, spread half of the cooked chicken mixture at the bottom.\n",
      "   - Layer half of the partially cooked rice on top of the chicken.\n",
      "   - Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves over the rice.\n",
      "   - Repeat with the remaining chicken and rice, and top with the remaining coriander and mint leaves.\n",
      "   - Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil or ghee over the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dum Cooking**\n",
      "   - Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If the lid isn't tight, seal the edges with a dough made from flour and water to trap the steam.\n",
      "   - Cook on a very low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rice to finish cooking with the steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Serve**\n",
      "   - Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, being careful not to break the rice grains.\n",
      "   - Serve hot with raita or a fresh salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your flavorful Chicken Biryani!\n"
